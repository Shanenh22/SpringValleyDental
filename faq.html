          <div class="faq-question">How often should I visit the dentist?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer collapsed">
            Most people should see their dentist for a checkup and cleaning twice a year. These regular visits allow us to catch potential problems early and keep your teeth and gums healthy. If you have gum disease, a history of cavities or other concerns, more frequent visits may be appropriate.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">How should I care for my teeth every day?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer collapsed">
            Good oral hygiene is the foundation of a healthy smile. <strong>Brush your teeth twice a day</strong> for at least two minutes using a fluoride toothpaste, and <strong>floss once a day</strong> to remove food particles and plaque between teeth. These daily habits, along with regular dental visits, help prevent cavities, gum disease and bad breath.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">How often should I replace my toothbrush?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer collapsed">
            Replace your manual toothbrush or electric brush head every <strong>three to four months</strong>‚Äîor sooner if the bristles are frayed‚Äîto ensure you're brushing effectively. Worn bristles remove less plaque and can irritate your gums.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What are the early signs of gum disease?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer collapsed">
            Watch for gums that <strong>bleed easily</strong> when brushing or flossing, persistent bad breath, redness, swelling or tenderness, receding gums and loose teeth. If you notice any of these signs, schedule a dental visit promptly‚Äîearly gum disease (gingivitis) is reversible with proper care.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Are dental X-rays safe?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer collapsed">
            Yes. A set of bite-wing dental X-rays exposes you to about 0.005 millisieverts of radiation, which is <strong>less than the natural background radiation</strong> you receive in a day (around 0.008 mSv) or a cross-country flight (about 0.02 mSv). Modern digital X-ray machines focus the beam on the area of interest, reducing scatter and often eliminating the need for lead aprons.

        <h2>Dental Treatments &amp; Procedures</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Does getting a dental implant hurt?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            No. Our dentists use local anesthetic and, when needed, sedation to make implant placement comfortable. You may feel pressure but not pain during the procedure. After surgery you might experience minor soreness that can be managed with over-the-counter pain relief and usually subsides within a few days.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">How long does a dental implant take to heal?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Healing times vary, but it generally takes <strong>three to nine months</strong> for the implant to fuse with your jawbone in a process called osseointegration. We place the crown after your bone has securely integrated with the implant to ensure long-term stability.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Is a root canal painful?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Root canal treatment has a reputation for being painful, but modern techniques and effective anesthesia make the procedure <strong>comparable to getting a filling</strong>. You should feel little to no discomfort while we clean and seal the tooth's canals, though you may experience mild tenderness afterwards that can be managed with analgesics.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Should I choose Invisalign or braces?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Clear aligners like Invisalign are removable and easier to clean but are generally more expensive and best suited for <strong>mild to moderate alignment issues</strong>. Traditional braces may be better for complex bite problems and can sometimes move teeth more effectively. We'll evaluate your smile and discuss which option fits your needs and lifestyle.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What are the alternatives to dental implants?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Bridges and partial dentures</strong> are common alternatives when implants aren't suitable. Bridges are less expensive and don't require surgery but must be replaced every five to seven years and can damage the supporting teeth. Partial dentures are removable, more budget friendly and fill gaps when nearby teeth cannot support a bridge; however, they are less stable and need daily cleaning.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What foods and drinks should I avoid after teeth whitening?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Your teeth are more porous and susceptible to staining for about <strong>48 hours after whitening</strong>. Avoid dark or tannin-rich beverages like coffee, tea and red wine; dark fruits and vegetables; sugary treats and fizzy drinks; tomatoes and citrus fruits; and sauces or foods with strong dyes. Sticking to a "white diet" of light-colored foods helps maintain your results.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What is oral sedation and how does it work?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Oral sedation is a form of conscious sedation that uses a prescribed pill to help you feel calm before and during your dental procedure. You take the medication about <strong>one hour before your appointment</strong>, and it produces a state of deep relaxation without putting you to sleep. You remain awake and able to respond to our instructions, but you may not remember all of the details of your visit.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What should I expect before, during and after sedation dentistry?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Before:</strong> You'll take the sedative pill around one hour before your appointment and arrange for someone to drive you to and from the office. Our team reviews your health history and monitors your vital signs.</p>
            <p><strong>During:</strong> You'll feel deeply relaxed and may notice a sensation of heaviness or tingling in your arms and legs. You'll remain conscious and can answer questions, but the details of the procedure may be fuzzy afterwards.</p>
            <p><strong>After:</strong> Because the effects can last for several hours, you should rest for the remainder of the day. Avoid driving, operating machinery or strenuous activities. Mild side effects such as grogginess, nausea or headaches may occur but usually resolve quickly.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Do I need someone to drive me home after sedation?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Yes.</strong> Even though you'll be awake during the procedure, the sedative can impair your reflexes and coordination. To ensure your safety, you must have a responsible adult accompany you and drive you home.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">How can I manage dental anxiety?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            We understand that visiting the dentist can be stressful for some patients. Sedation dentistry uses medications‚Äîsuch as <strong>nitrous oxide or a small pill</strong>‚Äîto help you relax during treatment. You remain conscious and able to respond to questions, but you won't feel pain or remember much of the procedure. Sedation can also allow us to complete multiple treatments in fewer visits, making your experience more efficient. Let us know if you feel anxious, and we'll discuss sedation options that can make your appointment more comfortable.

        <h2>Post‚ÄëOp Instructions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Root Canal Post-Operative Instructions:</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <ol>
              <li>A little bit of pain after root canal surgery is normal. Start pain medications BEFORE your anesthesia wears off. Start with Ibuprofen (such as Advil) 600 milligrams every six hours or 800 milligrams every eight hours unless your doctor says not to take Ibuprofen. Do not use Aspirin. If you cannot take Ibuprofen, taking two acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) every 6 hours works too.</li>
              <li>If an antibiotic is prescribed, make sure to take all of it and/or follow your dentist‚Äôs instructions. Antibiotics could stop birth control pills from working well. Please consult your physician if you have concerns.</li>
              <li>There might be some swelling and bruising which will be at its worst around 48-96 hours after surgery. To help with the swelling, gently put an ice pack over the surgical area. 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off, for around 3-4 hours. Make sure not to use ice over 6 hours. Do not fall asleep with ice on your face.</li>
              <li>Eating enough food and drinking enough water after surgery are the most important things to help the area get better faster. Do not eat sticky or crunchy foods in the first 3 days which could bother the surgical site.</li>
              <li>Starting the day after surgery, rinse gently with warm salt water (mix one teaspoon of salt into one glass of warm water) after meals and at bedtime or use the prescribed mouth rinse. This will help with cleaning and healing of the surgical site. You can keep brushing and flossing normally everywhere. You may brush gently around the treated area.</li>
              <li>Do not smoke for the first 24 hours following surgery.</li>
              <li>A little sensitivity or discomfort is normal for the first week. If you experience severe pain, swelling, or fever contact your dentist immediately.</li>
              <li>If you have anything you are worried about, please call your doctor any hour of the day or night.</li>
			<li>Please contact our office to schedule your follow up appointment and to place a permanent restoration.</li>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Oral Surgery Post-Operative Instructions:</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Local care</strong></p>
            <p>Bite on the gauze for 30 minutes. Change the gauze 30 minutes later. The gauze will be stained with blood when you remove it. That is not due to active bleeding, but due to the gauze‚Äôs ability to absorb blood. If your mouth is filling up with blood after removing the second gauze, place the gauze on the socket site and apply more pressure. If that does not stop the bleeding, wrap a moistened tea bag in gauze, and bite on it for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>Do not rinse out your mouth or spit. That causes more bleeding. Instead, lean over a sink or cup, and let the saliva drip out of your mouth without force.</p>
            <p>Avoid foods or activities that create suction in the mouth (e.g., straws, rinsing, spitting, etc).</p>
            <p>Avoid thermally hot foods (e.g., coffee, tea, soup). Let them cool before eating. On the day of surgery, most people find cool, soft foods (ice cream, yogurt) soothing. Consider soups, yogurt, ice cream, puddings, eggs, omelets, soft pasta.</p>
            <p>Avoid foods with a sharp edge (chips, crackers, toast etc) for 4-5 days.</p>
			 <p>AVOID ALCOHOL for a minimum of 7 days.</p> 
            <p>AVOID SMOKING for a minimum of 7 days. Smoking triples the risk of getting a painful, slow healing extraction socket called a ‚Äúdry socket.‚Äù</p>
            <p>Place ice to your cheek in the area of surgery. Ice is most effective if placed on the cheek for 20 minutes then removed for 20 minutes throughout the first day. Do not fall asleep with ice on face.</p>
            <p>Start pain relievers BEFORE your anesthesia wears off (30-60 minutes after your appointment). Unless otherwise specified, start with Ibuprofen (such as Advil or Aleve) 600 milligrams every six hours or 800 milligrams every eight hours. Do not use Aspirin. Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) 650 mg every 6 hours is a good alternative. Full doses of both ibuprofen and acetaminophen can be taken together or alternated every 3 hours. There is no bad interaction from taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen at the same time. It is much safer than taking too much of one medicine.</p>
            <p>Take other medicines as prescribed. Avoid driving or drinking alcohol if given prescription pain pills.</p>
            <p><strong>Day after surgery</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Gently rinse with warm salt water (1 teaspoon of salt in 1 glass of warm water) 4 times a day for one week or use the mouthrinse as prescribed by your dentist.</li>
              <li>Brush your teeth gently with a soft bristle brush. Avoid the brushing on the surgical site.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Two days after surgery</strong></p>
            <p>Place moist heat (a face towel in very warm, but not too hot, water or a hot water bottle) for swelling. Postoperative swelling is greatest 48-72 hours after surgery.</p>
            <p><strong>Bruising</strong></p>
            <p>Minor bruising after surgery is a normal response and no cause for alarm. It will improve in 7-14 days. If you are concerned at all, please call our office or your dentist.</p>
            <p><strong>Stiffness</strong></p>
            <p>Some jaw muscle stiffness is common, especially after longer procedures. This is normal and will improve in 7-14 days. Moist heat and Ibuprofen will help relieve some of these symptoms.</p>
            <p><strong>Sutures/Stitches</strong></p>
            <p>Most of our stitches dissolve on their own and will not have to be removed. The stitches will fall out within the week (some even come out the same day). Do not worry if the stiches are swallowed. Never pull at loose stitches, but you can carefully cut a loose stitch at the gum line. Some stitches may last 2 weeks, depending on the type (check with your dentist before leaving your appointment).</p>
            <p><strong>Pain</strong></p>
            <p>Most pain after surgery improves by the third day. If pain or swelling increases on the fourth day or later after surgery, call the office and ask to be seen by your doctor that day or the next day.</p>

          <div class="faq-question">Orthodontic Instructions:</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Oral Hygiene</strong></p>
            <p>Use a soft toothbrush when brushing. Place the bristles above the bracket/bands at a forty-five degree (45¬∞) angle towards the gums. Gently brush back and forth. Then brush the chewing and back surfaces of the teeth. Repeat this process overlapping the last tooth brushed and continue around the entire mouth. You may also carefully place bristles under the wire to help remove food under the wire. Make sure the bristles are directed away from your gums when doing this.</p>
            <p>You should brush your teeth for two minutes in the morning and at night. Patients with braces or aligners are at increased risk of cavities due to food and plaque being trapped more frequently than normal. Please follow the instructions carefully and diligently.</p>
            <p><strong>Flossing</strong></p>
            <p>Flossing with your orthodontic appliance is very hard. You may need to use floss threaders to get the floss under the wire or a water flosser can be used. After you get the floss under the wire, you may floss as usual by wrapping the floss in a ‚ÄúC‚Äù around the side of each tooth. Remove the floss and move to the next tooth. You should floss every day.</p>
            <p><strong>Clear Aligners</strong></p>
            <p>When eating, remove the clear aligners from your mouth and place your aligners in the protective case provided by your orthodontic provider. Never place your clear aligners in a napkin as this is likely to be thrown away into the garbage or lost. Make sure to keep your aligners away from pets as they could chew the aligners. Make sure to rinse your mouth with water after eating and brush your teeth as soon as possible. Only drink clear still water (not carbonated/sparkling water) with the aligners in.</p>
            <p><strong>Sports</strong></p>
            <p>Talk to your orthodontic provider if you play any contact sports during orthodontic treatment as they may recommend a mouth guard specifically for orthodontic appliances.</p>
            <p><strong>Care of your orthodontic appliance</strong></p>
            <p>Now that you have your orthodontic appliances, you will have to change your eating habits. Below is a list of different food groups and habits you will have to avoid or be careful with.</p>
            <p><em>Foods that damage your appliance:</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Popcorn</li>
              <li>Peanuts</li>
              <li>Ice Cubes</li>
              <li>Spareribs</li>
              <li>Taffy</li>
              <li>Corn Chips</li>
              <li>Chicken Legs</li>
              <li>Caramel</li>
              <li>Corn on the Cob</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Foods that need to be cut into small pieces before eating:</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Apples</li>
              <li>Hard breads</li>
              <li>Steak</li>
              <li>Raw vegetables</li>
              <li>Bagels</li>
              <li>Any foods that you would normally bite into with your front teeth need to be cut into small pieces before eating.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>If you eat/drink sweets, rinse your mouth with water and brush immediately.</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Soda</li>
              <li>Candy</li>
              <li>Cakes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Habits that can damage your appliance:</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Chewing on pencils/pens</li>
              <li>Biting on fingernails</li>
              <li>Pulling or picking at your appliance</li>
              <li>Rocking the headgear or lip bumper up and down</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Damaged Appliance</strong></p>
            <p>A bracket or band may loosen, or a wire may break. It is important that you call us immediately if anything breaks or feels different.</p>
            <p>You have been given wax that you may place over any irritating area until you come in to be checked. If you have a loose band, stop wearing your elastics.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Periodontal Surgery Post-Operative Instructions:</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Diet</strong></p>
            <p>Eat a soft diet such as pasta, meatloaf, fish, chicken, cooked vegetables, eggs, smoothies, or yogurt. Avoid crunchy foods such as hard breakfast cereal, hard crusted bread, raw vegetables, chips, popcorn, or nuts.</p>
            <p><strong>Medication</strong></p>
            <p>Continue taking any medications that you started before your surgery such as antibiotics or systemic steroids as instructed. Make sure to finish all the antibiotics that might be prescribed for you. It is recommended that you take a probiotic supplement when taking antibiotics. Please call the office to report any allergic reactions to any prescribed drug.</p>
            <p><strong>Discomfort</strong></p>
            <p>You may feel uncomfortable when the anesthesia wears off. Some discomfort after surgery is normal. Start to take pain medication BEFORE the anesthesia wears off (30-60 minutes after your appointment). Instead of taking narcotic medication such as Vicodin, you may take 2 tablets of Advil (Ibuprofen 200 mg each tablet) and 2 tablets of Tylenol (Acetaminophen) regular or extra strength every 4-6 hours. This combination has pain relief similar to a narcotic without the negative side effects of nausea, dizziness, and constipation.</p>
            <p><strong>Swelling</strong></p>
            <p>Swelling may occur and is normal. To lessen swelling during the first 48 hours, place an ice pack over the area for 20 minutes, then remove the ice for another 20 minutes. Repeat for 2-3 hours. After the first 48 hours, warm compresses (such as a warm, damp towel) will help lessen swelling.</p>
            <p><strong>Bleeding</strong></p>
            <p>Small amounts of blood may turn your saliva red for several hours. This is normal. Do not actively spit or rinse your mouth during the first 24-48 hours after surgery. Lean your head over a sink or cup, and let gravity pull the saliva out of your mouth. If persistent oozing occurs, firmly press a moistened tea bag over the area for 5-10 minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>Cleanliness</strong></p>
            <p>Brush and floss as usuall. If you have been given a prescription for antiseptic mouthwash, start using it the morning after surgery and use it twice a day.</p>
            
            <p><strong>No Smoking</strong></p>
            <p>Smoking will substantially reduce the healing and success of the surgery. Suction created when inhaling cigarettes can disturb the wound site and in the case of tooth extraction, the newly formed clot can dislodge. Smokers are at a greater risk of developing a painful dry socket.</p>
            <p>In case of extreme pain, swelling, or bleeding, contact us at (972) 852-2222.</p>
